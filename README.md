# Testing Special Characters

This repository is for our [Testing Special Characters project](https://11ways.github.io/screenreader-test-special-characters/),
where we reran Deque's test from 2014:
[Why Don’t Screen Readers Always Read What’s on the Screen? Part 1: Punctuation and Typographic Symbols](https://www.deque.com/blog/dont-screen-readers-read-whats-screen-part-1-punctuation-typographic-symbols/).

Feel free to use this repository for your own tests.
